[Profilinator](https://github.com/abhi12123/github-portfolio-generator) is web app that I've been working on for past few months. It generates a downloadable html porfolio website from given input fields.  
Even though there are some other applications that does the same, this one has an extra feature of generating data from Github and Devto profiles of the user. The data generation is using API calls that does not require authentication.  
An extra feature would be to use Linkedin profile to generate data, that could be a real gamechanger.
