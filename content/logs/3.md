*   Views
a name to the query that you can refer to

CREATE VIEW myview AS
                SELECT name, temp\_lo, temp\_hi, prcp, date, location
                FROM weather, cities
                WHERE city = name;
               SELECT \* FROM myview;

*   Foreign Keys
to make sure that no one can insert rows in the one table that do not have a matching entry in another table. This is called maintaining the referential integrity of your data.

CREATE TABLE cities (
                name varchar(80) primary key,
                location point
            );

CREATE TABLE weather (
                city varchar(80) references cities(name),
                temp\_lo int,
                temp\_hi int,
                prcp real,
                date date
               );

*   Transactions
Transactions are a fundamental concept of all database systems. The essential point of a transaction is that it bundles multiple steps into a single, all-or-nothing operation. The intermediate states between the steps are not visible to other concurrent transactions, and if some failure occurs that prevents the transaction from completing, then none of the steps affect the database at all. . A transaction is said to be atomic: from the point of view of other transactions, it either happens completely or not at all. We also want a guarantee that once a transaction is completed and acknowledged by the database system, it has indeed been permanently recorded and won't be lost even if a crash ensues shortly thereafter. when multiple transactions are running concurrently, each one should not be able to see the incomplete changes made by others. It's possible to control the statements in a transaction in a more granular fashion through the use of **savepoints**. Savepoints allow you to selectively discard parts of the transaction, while committing the rest. After defining a savepoint with SAVEPOINT, you can if needed roll back to the savepoint with ROLLBACK TO. All the transaction's database changes between defining the savepoint and rolling back to it are discarded, but changes earlier than the savepoint are kept.
