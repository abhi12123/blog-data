### Chapter 1. Tutorial

*   Create a database
`createdb dbname`*   Delete a database
`dropdb dbname`*   To start psql to interact with database
`psql dbname`*   To view tables in database
`\t`

### Chapter 2. The SQL Language

*   PostgreSQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS). That means it is a system for managing data stored in relations. Relation is essentially a mathematical term for table
*   Creating a New Table

CREATE TABLE weather (
                city varchar(80),
                temp\_lo int, -- low temperature
                temp\_hi int, -- high temperature
                prcp real, -- precipitation
                date date
               );

*   White space (i.e., spaces, tabs, and newlines) can be used freely in SQL commands
*   The point type is an example of a PostgreSQL-specific data type.
*   To drop tables in database

DROP TABLE tablename;

*   Populating a Table With Rows

INSERT INTO weather 
                VALUES ('San Francisco', 46, 50, 0.25,'1994-11-27');
            

alternative syntax allows you to list the columns explicitly:

INSERT INTO weather (city, temp\_lo, temp\_hi, prcp, date)
                VALUES ('San Francisco', 43, 57, 0.0, '1994-11-29');
            

You can list the columns in a different order if you wish or even omit some columns*   Querying a Table
The statement is divided into a select list (the part that lists the columns to be returned), a table list (the part that lists the tables from which to retrieve the data), and an optional qualification (the part that specifies any restrictions)

SELECT \* FROM weather;

Here \* is a shorthand for “all columns”*   Joins Between Tables
Queries can access multiple tables at once, or access the same table in such a way that multiple rows of the table are being processed at the same time. Queries that access multiple tables (or multiple instances of the same table) at one time are called **join queries**. They combine rows from one table with rows from a second table, with an expression specifying which rows are to be paired

SELECT \* FROM weather JOIN cities ON city = name;

Since the columns all had different names, the parser automatically found which table they belong to. If there were duplicate column names in the two tables you'd need to qualify the column names to show which one you meant, as in:

SELECT \* FROM weather JOIN cities ON weather.city = cities.name;

If no matching row is found we want some “empty values” to be substituted for the a table's columns. This kind of query is called an **outer join**.The earlier one is **inner joins**.

SELECT \* FROM weather LEFT OUTER JOIN cities ON weather.city = cities.name;

**left outer join** : table mentioned on the left of the join operator will have each of its rows in the output at least once, whereas the table on the right will only have those rows output that match some row of the left table. When outputting a left-table row for which there is no right-table match, empty (null) values are substituted for the right-table columns. **self join** : join a table against itself.*   Aggregate Functions
computes a single result from multiple input rows. eg count, sum, avg (average), max (maximum) and min (minimum).

SELECT max(temp\_lo) FROM weather;

Aggregate max cannot be used in the WHERE clause. the WHERE clause determines which rows will be included in the aggregate calculation; so it has to be evaluated before aggregate functions are computed. Task can be achieved using a SubQuery.

SELECT city FROM weather
                WHERE temp\_lo = (SELECT max(temp\_lo) FROM weather);

Aggregates are also very useful in combination with GROUP BY clauses.

SELECT city, max(temp\_lo)
                FROM weather
                GROUP BY city;

We can filter these grouped rows using **HAVING**

                SELECT city, max(temp\_lo)
                FROM weather
                GROUP BY city
                HAVING max(temp\_lo) < 40;
             

*   difference between WHERE and HAVING
WHERE selects input rows before groups and aggregates are computed, whereas HAVING selects group rows after groups and aggregates are computed*   Updates

UPDATE weather
                SET temp\_hi = temp\_hi - 2, temp\_lo = temp\_lo - 2
                WHERE date > '1994-11-28';

*   Deletions

DELETE FROM weather WHERE city = 'Hayward';

whereas

DELETE FROM tablename;

will remove all rows from the given table, leaving it empty
