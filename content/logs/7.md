Discused it with a friend of mine who asked the obvious question : 
### but why ?
Till now I had two repositories for my blog, one to host the github data and markdown files, and the other to serve the blog.   
Which led to some mundane task to publish the posts.  
Ill have to push the changes to one branch, then generate the webpage and serve it to another repo.  
Seems like it was possible with creating a branch instead of a repo, and moreover ( this is the best part ) it could have been automated with Github actions.

.

### Well
Here I am, created a seperate section to the current repo itself, presently, the same webpage will host the blog, and logs as well.
