title: "#1 Decided to learn SQL in depth"

I had learned SQL back in college, which gave me an idea about how databases work, transactions, relations etc. I have mostly focused on Front end technologies, since I had found them more interesting and creative than the Back end.  
On joining [Ceegees Software Solutions](https://ceegees.in/) back in 2021, I have been working on a web application which uses NestJs with PostgreSQL and typeOrm for the backend. I was able to achieve most of the features with my basic knowledge of sql and typeOrm, but it feels like going in depth like I have with the front end will help me understand and create better, error devoid code.  
  
Found a pretty long (O-O) Documentation on PostgreSQL over [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
